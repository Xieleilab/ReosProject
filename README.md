# Reos Project

The aim of this project is to provide free and ope-source tools for hydrological and hydraulic analysis.

# Lekan

## Presentation
The aim of Lekan is to assist the user in estimatind runoff hydrographs.

The user is able to define watershed in the GIS environment (based on QGIS engine) and evaluate the geometric characteristics from digital terrain models.

GIS environment allow to:
- load GIS data or open directly QGIS project for base map
- use raster DEM to automaticly delineate watershed and define longitudinale profile

The tool calculates concentration time with different formulas available and the user can apply runoff model to each watersheds.

With user defined rainfalls or designed rainfalls linked to watersheds following meteorological models, runoff hydrographs are calculated for each watersheds.
